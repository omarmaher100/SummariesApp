Project Arc
ClientApp folder. Now this folder has the Angular-related files, so we're not going to discuss about that now. The next folder is the Controllers folder. Inside this folder we can find all the Web API controllers. So for example we have the WeatherForecastCotroller, and this controller has a single API endpoint, the Get endpoint. The next, we have the Pages folder. Inside this folder we have three files, and the most important one is the ViewImports.cshtml, which is used to import all the necessary libraries that we can use throughout the views. For example, the TagHelpers. Another important folder is the wwwroot folder, and this folder is known as the root folder for the .NET Core apps. And this folder is mainly used to store static files like images, documents, et cetera, because by keeping the static documents in here we can easily access them. Another important file is the Program.cs file. And this file is also known as the entry file for the .NET apps. In here we can see the Main method, and inside the Main method we have the CreateWebHostBuilder method. And inside this method we can see that we have configured as our startup file, the Startup.cs file. So next we have the Startup.cs file which is also known as the configuration file because basically we can do in here all the configurations like the database connection strings, the services that we want to use, et cetera. Inside the Startup.cs we have two methods, the ConfigureServices and the Configure methods. The ConfigureSevices method is used to configure dependency interaction. And on the other hand we have the Configure method which is used to setup middle wares, routing rules, et cetera. So for example if we want to use a service in the future, we can configure it inside the ConfigureServices method.
